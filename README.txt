This program makes a Windows Batch script that WILL CRASH YOUR COMPUTER IF RAN ON IT! The code for the arduino ONLY
works on Windows 10 as it utilizes the windows+s key combo. This IS NOT a fully automated program as you have to select
the place you want to store the program, select all file types (Below the file name) then name it lol.bat. Once again,
THIS PROGRAM WILL OPEN ITSELF AND THERE IS NO STOPING IT UNLESS YOU EITHER TURN OFF THE COMPUTER OR THE RAM GETS FULL
DUE TO THE PROGRAM OPENING ITSELF AND CRASHES THE COMPUTER. I AM NOT responsible for ANY actions used with this code.
If you run this @ walmart and get kicked out, it is YOUR fault. NOT MINE. Anyways, have fun! :)
